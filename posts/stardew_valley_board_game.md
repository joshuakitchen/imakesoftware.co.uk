# Stardew Valley: The Board Game

Hello, I'm an avid gamer, and I've recently been trying to get into the board game scene, but board games are expensive
and knowing which one to pick is difficult.

I decided to try the Stardew Valley Board Game on [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com) and really enjoyed it, it's fun
both Solo and Co-Operative and I recommend it, it's challenging which I like and it's got enough systems to keep the game
interesting. This isn't a board game review however, this is imakesoftware.

The problem is I disliked have to pickup each piece in a simulator, it's fine for simple card games, but for this game each
season you have to move every tile into it's own pile, also there are redundant pieces depending on the amount of players
and you can't delete them. The little annoyances. I thought, "Wouldn't it be cool if there was a browser-version of this
game that wasn't annoying", so here we are.
